# AIML-project-2 (cardio vascular disease prediction)
Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease. It involves preprocessing medical data, visualizing important health features, analyzing correlations, and training multiple models such as Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression. The system helps classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on attributes like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors. The best model achieved an accuracy of 73.11%, demonstrating the potential of AIML in healthcare diagnostics.
